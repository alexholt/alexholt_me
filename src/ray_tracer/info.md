# Ray Tracer
## 2016-07-24

This week's project is a ray tracer based loosely on the first part of Peter
Shirley's book [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://www.amazon.com/Ray-Tracing-Weekend-Minibooks-Book-ebook/dp/B01B5AODD8#navbar).

[Juha Turunen](https://github.com/elpuri) helped me both with the math and the
concepts.
